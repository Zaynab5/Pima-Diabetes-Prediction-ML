# Diabetes Prediction Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting diabetes using machine learning models trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

## Files Included

- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Detailed instructions on dataset usage, model training, and interpretation of results.
- `diabetes_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation (if not directly downloaded from Kaggle).

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diabetes-Prediction-ML.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

## Results

The trained **Random Forest** model achieved high accuracy in predicting diabetes. Evaluation metrics:
- **Accuracy**: ~85%
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: Detailed in the notebook
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determines key health indicators influencing predictions

## Applications

This model can help doctors:
- Quickly assess a patientâ€™s risk of diabetes
- Focus on key health indicators for early diagnosis
- Support decision-making with data-driven insights
